Data Dictionary System Development History
===============================

Initial Setup and Backend Development
-----------------------------------
1. Created initial backend structure with FastAPI
2. Set up SQLite database with SQLAlchemy
3. Implemented core models:
   - Analysis
   - DataDictionary
   - CodeSnippet
   - QueryExecution
   - Review

AI Integration and Code Analysis
------------------------------
1. Integrated OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo for code analysis
2. Added Gemini as a fallback AI service
3. Implemented comprehensive code analysis features:
   - AST-based code structure analysis
   - AI-powered data dictionary extraction
   - Relationship detection
   - Code snippet analysis

Frontend Development
------------------
1. Set up React frontend with TypeScript
2. Implemented key components:
   - Analysis page for code submission
   - Data Dictionary viewer
   - Query execution history
   - User statistics dashboard
3. Added proper error handling and loading states

API Integration
-------------
1. Set up axios for API communication
2. Configured CORS for frontend-backend communication
3. Implemented endpoints:
   - /analyze for code analysis
   - /query-executions for tracking analysis history
   - /user/{user_id}/query-stats for user statistics
   - /health for system health monitoring

Database Management
-----------------
1. Implemented database initialization script
2. Added test user creation
3. Set up query execution tracking
4. Implemented data dictionary storage

Error Handling and Fixes
----------------------
1. Fixed port configuration (changed from 8000 to 3001)
2. Improved AI response parsing with JSON and regex fallback
3. Enhanced error handling in both frontend and backend
4. Added proper database connection verification
5. Fixed SQL query execution issues

Security and Environment
----------------------
1. Implemented proper API key handling
2. Added environment variable management
3. Set up secure token-based authentication
4. Protected sensitive endpoints

Testing and Verification
----------------------
1. Added health check endpoint
2. Implemented API testing script
3. Added database verification tests
4. Set up frontend unit tests

Current Status
-------------
- Backend running on port 3001
- Frontend running on port 3000
- Database properly storing analyses and query executions
- AI services (OpenAI/Gemini) functioning with fallback
- Full system integration with proper error handling
- Comprehensive data dictionary creation and management
- User interaction tracking and statistics

Next Steps
---------
1. Enhance AI response parsing
2. Add more comprehensive testing
3. Improve error handling and recovery
4. Enhance user interface and experience
5. Add more detailed documentation
